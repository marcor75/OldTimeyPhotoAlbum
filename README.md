oldtimey-photobook
==================

collection of photo galleries, organized in a sort of pre-digicam photo album.

Trying to build this photo gallery that looks like sort of a old photo album from the times before digital photography. User can either flip through the pages manually or jump to a specific page using the 'bookmark'-dropdown selector. Each page contains four thumbnails that, when clicked, load the respective photo gallery from a separate html file into a 'lightbox'. So far only the thumbnails 'Abstracticity1' on page 1 and 'Cities' on page 2 are linked to the related galleries. 

It works fine in Chrome 38, but in Firefox 33.1.1 the thumbnails are not clickable - or turn the page instead of opening the respective gallery. And I haven't even dared to look at IE yet!
