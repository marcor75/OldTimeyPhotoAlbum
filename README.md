Old-Timey Photo Album is an Experiment to create a pre-digital era photo album using CSS3 transforms and JS/jQuery, without the use of any plug-ins.

The album should have a page turn effect, a bookmark to flip to a selected page and clicking on a photo should open 
a 'lightbox' with a gallery of related images. 
           
PLEASE NOTE:
So far only the first photo on page 1 ("Ubud") and the last photo on page 2 ("Anuradhapura") open the related galleries.
The load-method for the other photos is not fully implemented yet.
                
Old-Timey Photo Album is best viewed in Chrome or Opera. Only works in safe mode in Firefox since update to v.37.
Does not work in IE. Not tested in Safari.
